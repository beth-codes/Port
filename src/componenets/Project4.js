         The Rose Hotel Project is a responsive landing page built with PHP, CSS, SASS, WordPress and MySQL. As a WordPress Developer, I am responsible for creating a customized design that reflects the hotel's unique aesthetic, as well as configuring & managing all necessary plugins required to ensure the project is optimized for the best user experience. Additionally, I am responsible for integrating all of the back-end data into the WordPress database so that necessary feature & content updates are reflected within the project.
